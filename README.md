# ActivityFramework
A simple framework to write activities in java.

Keep it simple. That's the main goal.

Inspired by Apache Camel route, I needed a simpler framework to describe an activity flow written in javacode.
Using a common framework to express a activity flow, javacode may be easer to read and a flow change
easer communicated.
