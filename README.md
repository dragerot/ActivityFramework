# ActivityFramework
A simple framework to write activities in java

Keep it simple. That's the main goal.

Inspired by Apache Camel route, I needed a simpler framework to describe an acitivy flow in javacode.
Using a common framework to express a activity flow in the javacode, code may be easer to read and a flow change
easer to understood and communicated.
